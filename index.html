        <h2> Luck | Sorte | 幸運 | Glück | Fortune | удача </h3>

        <p>Have you ever thought that luck is acquired through luck ?</p>

        <p>Luck is relative to the one experiencing it, but there is not an explanaition from where someone get luck despite out of pure luck</p>

        <p>Luck seems something msyterious like 'the force' in star wars, except it is not something that can be trained to gain or to keep a constant reserve</p>

        <p>The luck can be strong one day, but weak in another one, like the motion in a graph from a sine or cossine in math</p>

        <p>If luck is somewhat sine/cossine, is it a wavelenght of somekind that can influence the world around us and ourselves ?</p>

        <p>Could luck be a tool of god ? (or something in the lines of the Daedra Nocturnal from Skyrim ?)</p>
