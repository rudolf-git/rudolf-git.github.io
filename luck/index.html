<p>Have you ever thought that luck is acquired through luck ?</p>
<p>Luck is relative to the one experiencing it, but there is not an explanation from where someone get luck despite out of pure luck.</p>
<p>Luck seems something mysterious like &rsquo;the force&rsquo; in star wars, except it is not something that can be trained to gain or to keep a constant reserve.</p>
<p>The luck can be strong one day, but weak in another one, like the motion in a graph from a sine or cosine in math.</p>
<p>If luck is somewhat sine/cosine, is it a wavelength of some kind that can influence the world around us and ourselves ?</p>
<p>Could luck be a tool of god, a golden thread ? (or something in the lines of the Daedra Nocturnal from Skyrim ?)</p>
