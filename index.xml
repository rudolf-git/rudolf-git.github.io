From simple working Golems, that do wake you up in the morning, the ones that remind you of events, the ones that whenever you have a message or letter do the delivery.
To even more intelligent and hardworking ones, that do drive your car for you and even the ones that constantly admire you behavior, actions and tastes so they can share it to your butler what kind of meals you are enjoying the most.</description>
