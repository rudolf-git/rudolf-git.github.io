        <h2> Golems | Golens | ゴーレム | Golems | Golems | големы </h2>

        <p>Nowadays people create a lot of Golems to do their work, and someone's else work. These modern Golems, are nothing more then machines and automated tasks.</p>
        <p>From simple working Golems, that do wake you up in the morning, the ones that remind you of events, the ones that whenever you have a message or letter do the delivery. </p>
        <p>To even more intelligent and hardworking ones, that do drive your car for you and even the ones that constantly admire you behavior, actions and tastes so they can share it to your butler what kind of meals you are enjoying the most. The butler knowing that, they can serve you even better in the future that are seconds away.</p>
        <p>The Golems can do a variety of tasks, never once getting tired of doing it.</p>
        <p>But what would happen when the years pass by, when there will be even more summoned Golems than you can even imagine ? What about the orphan Golems, would they continue to do their relentlessly and restless work without their Creators to serve and to notice it ?</p>
        <p>Would they keep producing, even without their purpose, in the hopes that someday, somewhere, a little creator appears ?</p>
        <p>(Everything about the golems in here, i belive can be related to the universe/story of BLAME!, the movie is awesome by the way, I do recommend it)</p>
